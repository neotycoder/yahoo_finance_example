# yahoo_finance_example

This repo was created to demonstrate the python pandas module in conjunction with the yahoo finance module (yfinance). 

You are going to need to do a pip install of the following modules:

- pip3 install yfinance
- pip3 install pandas
- pip3 install ssl

I created these scripts to demonstrate not only some basic functionality of both the pandas and yfinance module, but also demonstrate how to create functions in Python 3.
